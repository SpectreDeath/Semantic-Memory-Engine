    "abstract": "The main idea of this work is to implement organic nanomaterials, such as thiophosphoryl-PMMH dendrimers, for the potential detection and remediation of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) contamination. An IR–thermal technique for determining the material specific surface morphology and defects of a thiophosphoryl-PMMH dendrimers is presented. Optical (UV-Vis), thermal (DSC), and electrical (dielectric spectroscopy and thermal imaging) characterizations show that the generation and number of surface groups influence the properties of the investigated dendrimers. Finally, general guidelines and procedures of thiophosphoryl-PMMH dendrimers with various generations are proposed for both civilian and military users.",

    "title": "The Role of Forensic Linguistics in Investigating and Disclosing Language Crimes on Social Media Platforms",
    "abstract": "The proliferation of crimes on social media platforms presents an increasingly complex challenge for society, demanding rigorous analysis and innovative solutions. This paper examines the potential of forensic linguistics in investigating and uncovering language crimes on social media. It explores how forensic linguistic approaches can systematically analyze the linguistic structures—from words to discourses—that constitute criminal communication in digital spaces. Through qualitative research employing document analysis, observation, and note-taking techniques on social media content, five distinct patterns of criminal language use were identified: (1) body shaming, involving insults directed at physical appearance; (2) defamation and libel against individuals and groups; (3) hate speech; (4) threats targeting specific parties or groups; and (5) incitement through the dissemination of false information about interlocutors. These patterns provide valuable insights into crimes that often elude conventional investigative methods. The study demonstrates that forensic linguistic approaches offer promising avenues for case resolution, providing government agencies and relevant institutions with effective tools to address the challenges posed by language crimes on social media platforms. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on digital criminology and highlights the critical role of linguistic analysis in navigating the complexities of online criminal behavior.",

    "title": "Forensic Linguistics in Southern Africa",
    "abstract": "This Element introduces the study of forensic linguistics, particularly in southern Africa, but also in Africa more generally. In the past six decades, there has been clear evidence that the discipline of forensic linguistics is, or was, unknown to general linguists, legal linguists, and applied linguists on the African continent. Now, however, the situation is rapidly changing, with forensic linguistics studies gaining momentum in various parts of Africa. In this Element the authors introduce the topic, define the discipline, address the language of record issue in southern Africa, as well as critically debate the state of court interpreting and translation of documentation into African languages, address police interviewing techniques, while also looking at possible future developments in the discipline of forensic linguistics. This title is also available as Open Access on Cambridge Core.",
